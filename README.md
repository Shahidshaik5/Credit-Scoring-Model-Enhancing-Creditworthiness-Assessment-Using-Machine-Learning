# Credit Scoring Model: Enhancing Creditworthiness Assessment Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of individuals or companies accurately. Using the dataset from the "Home Credit Default Risk" Kaggle competition, this project will identify key factors influencing creditworthiness and compare various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
